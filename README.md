# SafeCircle AI — Phase 1: Project Foundation

> "Google Maps tells you the fastest route. SafeCircle AI tells you the safest route."

Built for **Vibe2Vision (IEEE SHE Aspire 3.0)** — Track 1: SafeSphere.

This is **Phase 1 only**: architecture, routing, layouts, design tokens, and
reusable components. No AI, maps, backend, or Supabase logic is implemented
yet — every screen is a real, styled shell ready for Phase 2 to fill in.

## Tech stack

- React 19 + Vite + TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`, CSS-first `@theme` tokens)
- React Router v7 (data router)
- TanStack React Query (client configured, no queries yet)
- Framer Motion (installed, minimal — visual polish is a later phase)
- Supabase-ready service layer (`src/services/supabaseClient.ts`, unwired)
- lucide-react icons, clsx + tailwind-merge for class composition


Deploys as a static Vite app — works out of the box on Vercel.


## What's intentionally NOT here yet

Maps, the Women Safety Index, community reporting logic, AI route
recommendation/explanation, Journey Mode logic, Supabase auth/data, and any
backend — all deferred to later phases per the Phase 1 scope.
